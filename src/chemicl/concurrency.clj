;; Programs are monadic. You can use the usual active.clojure.monad tools.

(defn throw
  "Divert execution to the given continuation"
  [k v] (make-throw k v))

(defn exit
  "Quit the current thread"
  [] (make-exit-command))

;; The concurrency language is shared-memory-based.

(defn new-ref
  "Create a new shared-memory cell"
  [init] (make-new-ref-command init))

(defn read
  "Read the value inside a shared-memory cell"

  Returns falsey iff the cas failed."

;; Timeout
